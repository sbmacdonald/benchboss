Hi ORGANIZER,

An RSVP system as been setup for your league: EMAIL_ACCOUNT_NAME.

The League Administration*<a href="URL_BASE/admin/>pages will allow you to manage the following:

  - Roster (regulars and spares)
  - Check Attendance
  - Update League Info (including games time/location etc)
  - Send group emails

*The administrator userid and password will be sent to you separately.*

Scott
